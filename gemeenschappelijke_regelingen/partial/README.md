#Gemeenschappelijke regelingen

It is quite hard to find a list of all gemeenschappelijke regelingen (GR) in The Netherlands, let alone that it contains addresses or is standardized in any way. We needed such a list (though only for a subset of roughly 150 GRs) and thus set out to make it ourselves by combining data from different sources (e.g., mosly by searching online, and sometimes using this incomplete list on almanak.overheid.nl. The main source is this PDF file found on a page of government website dsta.nl. We retrieved an .xlsx version of the PDF by requesting it via the 'Wet hergebruik van overheidsinformatie'. We then converted this to a CSV and added GRs which were not listed. We also added a mapping between the GR names used by the DSTA to the GR names and unique GR codes/identigiers used by the CBS (Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek), which has a partial list of GRs.

This dataset is not complete, and most likely contains errors(!). Still it is the most complete list we currently know of, but we welcome any contributions to make it even better!
